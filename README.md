Welcome to my personal learning repository on how to calculate the U parameter in Density Functional Theory. 

As a beginner in the field of DFT+U, I've created this repository to document my learning journey and share my insights with others.


## What is DFT+U?

Density Functional Theory with the DFT+U method is a powerful approach used in materials science and condensed matter physics to correct the self-interaction error and improve the description of strongly correlated electron systems. Calculating the U parameter is a crucial step in using this method effectively.
